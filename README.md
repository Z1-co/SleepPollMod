# Description

SleepPoll is a server-sided Minecraft Fabric mod that introduces a voting system for skipping the night. When a player enters a bed, a poll is automatically created, allowing all online players to vote on whether to skip the night or keep it. Players can vote "yes" or "no" through clickable in-game messages. The night is skipped if the combined percentage of sleeping players and "yes" votes meets the server-defined threshold. This mod is perfect for multiplayer servers, ensuring fair gameplay by letting the community decide on nighttime transitions.
